"""A builder for the BeanMachine Graph language

The Beanstalk compiler has, at a high level, five phases.

* First, it transforms a Python model into a semantically
  equivalent program "single assignment" (SA) form that uses
  only a small subset of Python features.

* Second, it transforms that program into a "lifted" form.
  Portions of the program which do not involve samples are
  executed normally, but any computation that involves a
  stochastic node in any way is instead turned into a graph node.

  Jargon note:

  Every graph of a model will have some nodes that represent
  random samples and some which do not. For instance,
  we might have a simple coin flip model with three
  nodes: a sample, a distribution, and a constant probability:

  def flip():
    return Bernoulli(0.5)

  sample --> Bernoulli --> 0.5

  We'll refer to the nodes which somehow involve a sample,
  either directly or indirectly, as "stochastic" nodes.

* Third, we actually execute the lifted program and
  accumulate the graph.

* Fourth, the accumulated graph tracks the type information
  of the original Python program. We mutate the accumulated
  graph into a form where it obeys the rules of the BMG
  type system.

* Fifth, we either create actual BMG nodes in memory via
  native code interop, or we emit a program in Python or
  C++ which does so.

This module implements the graph builder that is called during
execution of the lifted program; it implements phases
three, four and five.
