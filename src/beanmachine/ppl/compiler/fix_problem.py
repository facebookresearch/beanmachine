# A "node fixer" is a partial function on nodes; it is similar to a "rule". (See rules.py)
# What distinguishes a node fixer from a rule?
#
# * A node fixer is not an instance of a Rule class; it's just a function.
#
# * A node fixer returns:
#   1. None or Inapplicable if the fixer did not know how to fix the problem
#      TODO: Eliminate use of None as a special return value from a node fixer.
#      Node fixers should return Inapplicable, Fatal, or a node.
#   2. The same node as the input, if the node does not actually need fixing.
#   3. A new node, if the fixer did know how to fix the problem
#   4. Fatal, if the node definitely cannot be fixed, so compilation should cease.
#
#   Note the subtle difference between (1) and (2). Suppose we compose a set of n
#   fixers together, as in the first_match combinator below. If the first fixer
#   returns Inapplicable, then we try the second fixer. If the first fixer returns the
#   input, then that fixer is saying that the node is already correct, and we
#   should not try the second fixer.
#
# * A node fixer mutates an existing graph by adding a new node to it; a Rule just
#   returns a success code containing a new value.
#
# * Rules may be combined together with combinators that apply sub-rules to
#   various branches in a large tree, and the result of such a combination is
#   itself a Rule. Node fixers are combined together to form more complex fixers,
#   but they still just operate on individual nodes. The work of applying node fixers
#   over an entire graph is done by a GraphFixer.

    # Applies the node fixer to each node in the graph builder that is an ancestor,
    # of any sample, query, or observation, starting with ancestors and working
    # towards decendants. Fixes are done one *edge* at a time. That is, when
    # we enumerate a node, we check all its input edges to see if the input node
    # needs to be fixed, and if so, then we update that edge to point from
    # the fixed node to its new output.
    #
    # We enumerate each output node once, but because we then examine each of its
    # input edges, we will possibly encounter the same input node more than once.
    #
    # Rather than rewriting it again, we memoize the result and reuse it.
    # If a fixer indicates a fatally unfixable node then we attempt to report an error
    # describing the problem with the edge. However, we will continue to run fixers
    # on other nodes, hoping that we might report more errors.
    #
    # A typer associates type information with each node in the graph. We have some
    # problems though:
    #
    # * We frequently need to accurately know the type of a node when checking to
    #   see if it needs fixing.
    # * Computing the type of a node requires computing the types of all of its
    #   *ancestor* nodes, which can be quite expensive.
    # * If a mutation changes an input of a node, that node's type might change,
    #   which could then change the types of all of its *descendant* nodes.
    #
    # We solve this performance problem by (1) computing types of nodes on demand
    # and caching the result, (2) being smart about recomputing the type of a node
    # and its descendants when the graph is mutated.  We therefore tell the typer
    # that it needs to re-type a node and its descendants only when a node changes.
    #
    # CONSIDER: Could we use a simpler algorithm here?  That is: for each node,
    # try to fix the node. If successful, remove all the output edges of the old
    # node and add output edges to the new node.  The problem with this approach
    # is that we might end up reporting an error on an edge that is NOT in the
    # subgraph of ancestors of samples, queries and observations, which would be
    # a bad user experience.
