/*
Creates a MarginalDistribution to replace the discrete node
and other affected nodes.

The MarginalDistribution has a stand-alone "subgraph", which will contain
all of the nodes required to compute the MarginalDistribution
1. the discrete distribution node
2. the discrete sample node
3. deterministic children nodes of the discrete sample up until
4. the stochastic children nodes of the discrete sample
5. the parents (a node not in 1-4 that has a child in 1-4)

The original graph will be modified to contain
1. the MarginalDistribution node (to replace #1-3 from the
   subgraph above)
2. the children of the MarginalDistribution, which are the
   stochastic children nodes of the discrete node
   (the same as #4 from the subgraph)
3. the parents of the MarginalDistribution, which are the parents
   of the subgraph (same as #5 from the subgraph)

In order to keep the original graph and the subgraph completely
independent, there are a few key points.

PARENTS:
The parents of the MarginalDistribution are the nodes not in the subgraph
that have a child in the subgraph.
To keep the subgraph as a "stand-alone" graph, we need to make sure that
it does not contain incoming nodes from the graph. To do this, we
we make a "copy" node in the subgraph for each of the parents in the graph.
This "copy" node in the subgraph is a Constant node whose value is the
same as the parent node in the graph.

CHILDREN:
The children of the MarginalDistribution are the stochastic children of
the discrete sample node.
The stochastic children are needed to compute the
log prob of the MarginalDistribution,
so they are part of the subgraph.
However, a "copy" of these children also needs to be added to the graph.
This "copy" node is a SAMPLE node of MarginalDistribution whose value
is the same as the stochastic child node in the subgraph.
