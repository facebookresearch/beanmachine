// A deduplicated graph is one in which there is only one (shared) copy of

// elimination.  The nodes in the resulting data structure will have only one
// (shared) copy of equivalent expressions (that is, every pair of distinct
// nodes in the resulting data structure are semantically different). The
// programmer must either specialize DedupAdapter<T> or provide a type to be

// a DAG (directed acyclic graph) of nodes that is no longer a tree due to
