# Tutorial: **Hierarchical modeling with repeated binary trial data**


In this tutorial we will demonstrate the application of hierarchical models with data
from the 1970 season of [Major League Baseball (MLB)](#references) found in the paper by
[Efron and Morris 1975](#references).


## Learning Outcomes


On completion of this tutorial, you should be able:

* to prepare data for running a hierarchical model with Bean Machine;
* to execute a hierarchical model with Bean Machine;
* to explain what different pooling techniques tell us about the data; and
* to run diagnostics to understand what Bean Machine is doing.


## Problem


Data are from [Efron and Morris 1975](#references), which are taken from the 1970 Major
League Baseball season for both the American and National leagues,
[Wikipedia (Major League Baseball)](#references). These data are an example of repeated
binary trials in that a player has multiple opportunities (trials) for being at-bat and
they can either land a hit or miss the ball (binary outcome). Many useful scenarios can
be modeled as having repeated binary trials. For example; browser click data, watching a
video to completion, voting for or against propositions in a session of
congress/parliament, and even rat tumor development, see [Tarone](#references).

Our task is to use the given baseball data and create a hierarchical model that
estimates the chances each player has to land a hit when they are at-bat.


## Prerequisites


We wil be using the following packages within this tutorial.

* [arviz](https://arviz-devs.github.io/arviz/) and
  [bokeh](https://docs.bokeh.org/en/latest/docs/) for interactive visualizations; and
* [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) for data manipulation.


```python
# Install Bean Machine in Colab if using Colab.
import sys


if "google.colab" in sys.modules and "beanmachine" not in sys.modules:
    !pip install beanmachine
```

```python
import os
from io import StringIO

import arviz as az
import beanmachine.ppl as bm
import pandas as pd
import torch
import torch.distributions as dist
from beanmachine.ppl.model import RVIdentifier
from beanmachine.tutorials.utils import baseball
from bokeh.io import output_notebook
from bokeh.plotting import gridplot, show
from IPython.display import SVG, Markdown
```

The next cell includes convenient configuration settings to improve the notebook
presentation as well as setting a manual seed for `torch` for reproducibilty.


```python
# Plotting settings
az.rcParams["plot.backend"] = "bokeh"
az.rcParams["plot.bokeh.figure.dpi"] = 60
az.rcParams["stats.hdi_prob"] = 0.89

# Manual seed for torch
torch.manual_seed(1199)

# Other settings for the notebook.
smoke_test = "SANDCASTLE_NEXUS" in os.environ or "CI" in os.environ
```

## Data


We explore the data below to help inform our decisions about priors and sampling
distributions for our models. The insights will be used to create logical procedures for
processing information, see [McElreath](#references) for further discussion about
creating data stories, and their importance for model building.

The raw data contain the following columns.

| Column name          | Description                                     |
| -------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **FirstName**        | Player's first name                             |
| **LastName**         | Player's last name                              |
| **At-Bats**          | 45 for each player                              |
| **Hits**             | Hits in first 45 at-bats                        |
| **BattingAverage**   | Batting average after first 45 at-bats          |
| **RemainingAt-Bats** | Batting average for the remainder of the season |
| **SeasonAt-Bats**    | Number of at-bats for entire season             |
| **Season Hits**      | Number of hits for entire season                |
| **SeasonAverage**    | Batting average for entrie season               |

The selected players include _Roberto Clemente_ explicitly because he was presumed to be
an outlier. See [Efron and Morris, 1977](#references) for further discussion.

We now read the data in as a `pandas` dataframe. The data are replicated below using a
`StringIO` object rather than reading from a `CSV` file.

The next cell contains standard `pandas` transformations to make the data clearer for
later analysis. We also rename a few columns for readability.


```python
# Rename columns in order to make the data clearer.
renames = {

The above dataframe shows us that each player had a different number of opportunities to
be at-bat over the course of the season; the `Season at-bats` column. We also see a
defined slice in time where all the players have had the same number of opportunities to
be at-bat, the `Current at-bats` column, which is all 45. The number of successful hits
a player has made within the first 45 trials is given in the `Current hits` column, as
well as the total number of hits for the season in `Season hits`.

Below we see an ordered scatter plot of the `Current hits` column.


```python
# Required for visualizing in Colab.
output_notebook(hide_banner=True)

current_hits = baseball.plot_current_hits(df)
show(current_hits)
```

<CurrentHits />

The data are telling us that each player is unique (there are not a lot with the same
number of hits), but also that they are similar. The players are similar because they
are all highly trained in their sport, and have a much better chance of hitting a ball
when at-bat then an average person not in the MLB. The data also tell us that we have
captured a slice in time where each player has been given the same number of
opportunities to be at-bat, and all of them had different amounts of success at landing
a hit. We can estimate the chance a player has at hitting a ball when at-bat.


## Models


We will create three separate models using the above data as we explore how to create a
hierarchical model using Bean Machine. The models we will be creating are:

* [complete-pooling](#complete-pooling);
* [no-pooling](#no-pooling);
* [partial-pooling](#parital-pooling).

Each model will estimate a baseball player's chance of landing a hit when they are
at-bat. We can assume that every time a player is at-bat is a new independent Bernoulli
trial (see [Wikipedia (Bernoulli trial)](#references)) so we can model the chance a
player has when at-bat as a Binomial distribution, see [Wikipedia
(Binomial)](#references).

$$
p(y_n\mid\phi)=\text{Binomial}(y_n\mid K_n,\phi)
$$

where

* $\phi$ is our prior;
* $y_n$ are the number of times a player makes a hit (number of successes);
* $K_n$ is the number of times that player has been at-bat (number of trials).

**`NOTE`** We can implement this model in Bean Machine by defining random variable
objects with the `@bm.random_variable` and `@bm.functional` decorators. These functions
behave differently than ordinary Python functions.


<div
  style={
    {
      background: "#daeaf3",
      border_left: "3px solid #2980b9",
      display: "block",
      margin: "16px 0",
      padding: "12px",
    }
  }
>
  Semantics for <code>@bm.random_variable</code> functions:
  <ul>
    <li>
      They must return PyTorch <code>Distribution</code> objects.
    </li>
    <li>
      Though they return distributions, callees actually receive <i>samples</i> from the
      distribution. The machinery for obtaining samples from distributions is handled
      internally by Bean Machine.
    </li>
    <li>
      Inference runs the model through many iterations. During a particular inference
      iteration, a distinct random variable will correspond to exactly one sampled
      value: <b>calls to the same random variable function with the same arguments will
      receive the same sampled value within one inference iteration</b>. This makes it
      easy for multiple components of your model to refer to the same logical random
      variable.
    </li>
    <li>
      Consequently, to define distinct random variables that correspond to different
      sampled values during a particular inference iteration, an effective practice is
      to add a dummy "indexing" parameter to the function. Distinct random variables
      can be referred to with different values for this index.

  </ul>

<a id="complete-pooling"></a>

### Complete-pooling model


![](assets/img/complete-pooling-dag.svg)


The image above is a graphical representation of what complete pooling does: it assumes
that everyone's chance of landing a hit is sampled from the same population distribution
$\phi$. This model assumes that all the player's chances of hitting a ball are the
_same_, which is an extreme statement compared to our data story that said all players
were _similar_. This is something we will fix in later model.

If we assume no prior knowledge about the players then our prior ($\phi$) is a uniform
distribution from $[0, 1]$. Bean Machine works well with `Uniform` priors, but we will
choose to use a $\text{Beta(1, 1)}$ distribution as our prior because it is a conjugate
prior to a Binomial distribution. Our `complete-pooling` model can be written as

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \phi & \sim\text{Beta}(1,1)\\
     y & \sim\text{Binomial}(K,\phi).
\end{aligned}
$$


#### Beta priors _vs_ Uniform priors


Below we can see why swapping a `Uniform` distribution for a `Beta(1, 1)` is appropriate
as they are the same.


```python
# Required for visualizing in Colab.
output_notebook(hide_banner=True)

complete_pooling_priors = baseball.plot_complete_pooling_priors()
show(complete_pooling_priors)
```

<CompletePoolingPriors />

We can create our `complete-pooling` model in Bean Machine using the
`@bm.random_variable` decorator.


```python
N = df.shape[0]
current_at_bats = torch.tensor(df["Current at-bats"].astype(float).values)
current_hits = torch.tensor(df["Current hits"].astype(float).values)


@bm.random_variable
def complete_pooling_phi() -> RVIdentifier:
    return dist.Beta(1, 1)


@bm.random_variable
def complete_pooling_y() -> RVIdentifier:
    return dist.Binomial(current_at_bats, complete_pooling_phi().expand((N,)))
```

In the code cell above we have defined our population prior and chance of landing a hit
when at-bat in the top-level namespace of our notebook. Bean Machine can take advantage
of creating models as classes as well, and we illustrate how to do that below for our
`complete-pooling` model. We will not use the class method for the rest of the tutorial,
however, it does show you how to accomplish creating the model as a class object in
Python.

We make use of the `expand` method on pytorch distribution objects to perform batch
sampling. This has the advantage of being more computationally-efficient than explicit
iteration. Bean Machine is also able to take advantage of the implicit broadcasting of
pytorch tensors and pytorch samplers like `dist.Binomial` allowing us to sample or
observe all $y$ values at once.


```python
class CompletePoolingModel:
    @bm.random_variable
    def complete_pooling_phi(self) -> RVIdentifier:
        return dist.Beta(1, 1)

    @bm.random_variable
    def complete_pooling_y(self, i: int, k: int) -> RVIdentifier:
        return dist.Binomial(k, self.complete_pooling_phi())


complete_pooling_model = CompletePoolingModel()
```

#### Complete-pooling inference


Inference is the process of combining model and data to obtain insights, in the form of
probability distributions over values of interest. Bean Machine offers a powerful and
general inference framework to enable fitting arbitrary models to data.

Our inference algorithms expect a dictionary where the keys are `@bm.random_variable`
invocations, and tensor data as our observational values. You can see this in the
example below.


```python
complete_pooling_observations = {complete_pooling_y(): current_hits}
complete_pooling_observations
```

<CellOutput>
{`{RVIdentifier(wrapper=<function complete_pooling_y at 0x7f24101392d0>, arguments=()): tensor([18., 17., 16., 15., 14., 14., 13., 12., 11., 11., 10., 10., 10., 10.,
         10.,  9.,  8.,  7.], dtype=torch.float64)}`}
</CellOutput>

We are ready to run inference on our model and observations. Bean Machine supports a
rich library of inference algorithms that share a common `infer` method with the
following arguments:

| Name           | Usage                                                                                         |
|----------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `queries`      | A list of @bm.random_variable targets to fit posterior distributions for.                     |
| `observations` | The Dict of observations we built up, above.                                                  |
| `num_samples`  | Number of samples to build up distributions for the values listed in queries.                 |
| `num_chains`   | Number of separate inference runs to use. Multiple chains can verify inference ran correctly. |

For this particular problem, we will use the `GlobalNoUTurnSampler` inference method.
Bean Machine's `GlobalNoUTurnSampler` is the NUTS sampler you have probably used before
with `stan` or `pymc3`. We have chosen to use the NUTS sampler here because it can be
easily compared to other probabilistic tools.


```python
num_samples = 2 if smoke_test else 5000
num_adaptive_samples = 0 if smoke_test else 2500
num_chains = 4

complete_pooling_queries = [complete_pooling_phi()]

complete_pooling_samples = bm.GlobalNoUTurnSampler().infer(
    queries=complete_pooling_queries,
    observations=complete_pooling_observations,
    num_samples=num_samples,
    num_chains=num_chains,
    num_adaptive_samples=num_adaptive_samples,
)
```

<CellOutput>

#### Complete-pooling analysis


The `complete_pooling_samples` object contains our inference results. We have only one
parameter in this model, $\phi$, which was supplied as a single query parameter when we
ran inference. After inference has been run, we need to ensure our model has fit the
data appropriately. We begin this analysis by printing out summary statistics with two
important statistics $\hat{R}$ (`r_hat`) and effective sample size (`ess`) values, see
[Vehtari _et al_](#references).


```python
complete_pooling_summary_df = az.summary(
    complete_pooling_samples.to_xarray(),
    round_to=4,
)
Markdown(complete_pooling_summary_df.to_markdown())
```

#### Measuring variance between- and within-chains with $\hat{R}$ (`r_hat`)


$\hat{R}$ is a diagnostic tool that measures the between- and within-chain variances. It
is a test that indicates a lack of convergence by comparing the variance between
multiple chains to the variance within each chain. If the parameters are successfully
exploring the full space for each chain, then $\hat{R}\approx 1$, since the
between-chain and within-chain variance should be equal. $\hat{R}$ is calculated as

$$
\hat{R}=\frac{\hat{V}}{W}
$$

where $W$ is the within-chain variance and $\hat{V}$ is the posterior variance estimate
for the pooled rank-traces. The take-away here is that $\hat{R}$ converges towards 1
when each of the Markov chains approaches perfect adaptation to the true posterior
distribution. We do not recommend using inference results if $\hat{R}>1.01$. More
information about $\hat{R}$ can be found in the [Vehtari _et al_](#references) paper.


#### Effective sample size (`ess`)


MCMC samplers do not draw independent samples from the target distribution, which means
that our samples are correlated. In an ideal situation all samples would be independent,
but we do not have that luxury. We can, however, measure the number of _effectively
independent_ samples we draw, which is called the effective sample size. You can read
more about how this value is calculated in the [Vehtari _et al_](#references) paper,
briefly it is a measure that combines information from the $\hat{R}$ value with the
autocorrelation estimates within the chains. There are many ways to estimate effective
samples sizes, however, we will be using the method defined in the [Vehtari _et
al_](#references) paper.

The rule of thumb for `ess_bulk` is for this value to be greater than 100 per chain on
average. Since we ran four chains, we need `ess_bulk` to be greater than 400 for each
parameter. The `ess_tail` is an estimate for effectively independent samples considering
the more extreme values of the posterior. This is not the number of samples that landed
in the tails of the posterior. It is a measure of the number of effectively independent
samples if we sampled the tails of the posterior. The rule of thumb for this value is
also to be greater than 100 per chain on average.

We can use `arviz` to plot the evolution of the effective sample size for each of our
parameters. The below plots show over each successive draw from our model, the estimated
effective sample size for our parameters. The red horizontal dashed line shows the
rule-of-thumb value needed for both the bulk and tail `ess` estimates. When the model is
converging properly, both the bulk and tail lines should be _roughly_ linear.


```python
# Required for visualizing in Colab.
output_notebook(hide_banner=True)

data = {"φ": complete_pooling_samples.get(complete_pooling_phi()).numpy()}
complete_pooling_ess_plot = az.plot_ess(data, kind="evolution", show=False)[0][0]
complete_pooling_ess_plot.plot_width = 600
complete_pooling_ess_plot.plot_height = 400
complete_pooling_ess_plot.y_range.start = 0
complete_pooling_ess_plot.outline_line_color = "black"
complete_pooling_ess_plot.grid.grid_line_alpha = 0.2
complete_pooling_ess_plot.grid.grid_line_color = "grey"
complete_pooling_ess_plot.grid.grid_line_width = 0.2
show(complete_pooling_ess_plot)
```

<CompletePoolingEssPlot />

When the model is converging properly, both the bulk and tail lines from the `ess`
evolution plot should be _roughly_ linear. We can see that both the `ess_bulk` and
`ess_tail` are above the rule-of-thumb value of 400 (the red dashed line), which
indicates that the model is fitting the data.

Below we have two more diagnostic plots for individual random variables: Rank plots and
autocorrelation plots.

* `Rank plots` are a histogram of the samples over time. All samples across all
  chains are ranked and then we plot the average rank for each chain on regular
  intervals. If the chains are mixing well this histogram should look roughly uniform.
  If it looks highly irregular that suggests chains might be getting stuck and not
  adequately exploring the sample space.
* `Autocorrelation plots` measure how predictive the last several samples are
  of the current sample. Autocorrelation may vary between -1.0 (deterministically
  anticorrelated) and 1.0 (deterministically correlated). We compute autocorrelation
  approximately, so it may sometimes exceed these bounds. In an ideal world, the current
  sample is chosen independently of the previous samples: an autocorrelation of zero.
  This is not possible in practice, due to stochastic noise and the mechanics of how
  inference works.


```python
# Required for visualizing in Colab.
output_notebook(hide_banner=True)

complete_pooling_diagnostics_plot = gridplot(
    [baseball.plot_complete_pooling_diagnostics(complete_pooling_samples)]
)
show(complete_pooling_diagnostics_plot)
```

<CompletePoolingDiagnosticsPlot />

The first figure is the distribution for each chain we ran inference for. We can see the
distributions look well behaved (_i.e._ there are not a lot of oscillations). Next to
the distribution plot is the rank plot we discussed above. We can see from the
histograms for each chain that these plots all look fairly uniform. The black dashed
line is used as a guide to ensure the bars are uniform. Finally next to the rank plot
are the autocorrelation plots for each chain for this query. We can see some
correlations, but overall the plots show the chains have mixed.

Below we plot our final diagnostic, which is the posterior for our parameter $\phi$.
Here we see an interval of 89% that defines the highest density interval (HDI), which
tells us where the greatest amount of density for the posterior lies. Why an 89% HDI
instead of 95%? To prevent you from thinking about a 95% confidence interval. See
[McElreath](#references) for further discussion on this subject.


```python
# Required for visualizing in Colab.
output_notebook(hide_banner=True)

complete_pooling_phi_posterior = az.plot_posterior(
    {"φ": complete_pooling_samples.get(complete_pooling_phi()).numpy()},
    show=False,
)[0][0]
complete_pooling_phi_posterior.plot_width = 400
complete_pooling_phi_posterior.plot_height = 400
complete_pooling_phi_posterior.y_range.start = 0
complete_pooling_phi_posterior.outline_line_color = "black"
complete_pooling_phi_posterior.grid.grid_line_alpha = 0.2
complete_pooling_phi_posterior.grid.grid_line_color = "grey"
complete_pooling_phi_posterior.grid.grid_line_width = 0.2
show(complete_pooling_phi_posterior)
```

<CompletePoolingPhiPosterior />

What this is telling us from our model and data is that every player will have the same
chance of hitting a ball when at-bat. This finding is not correct and is evident when we
plot all the players in the same plot showing their chances of success when at-bat.


```python
# Required for visualizing in Colab.
output_notebook(hide_banner=True)

complete_pooling_model_plot = baseball.plot_complete_pooling_model(
    df,
    complete_pooling_samples,
    complete_pooling_phi(),
)
show(complete_pooling_model_plot)
```

<CompletePoolingModelPlot />

The above plot shows our predictions for each player's chance of hitting a ball when
at-bat, with error bars being the 89% HDI and the markers being the mean of the
posterior. The orange horizontal line shows the population mean from the data (_i.e._
$Current\ hits / Current\ at\ bats$), and the orange box shows the standard deviation
for the actual data.

We know every player is unique, but we have not captured that information as the plot
shows that every player is the same. The model also tells us that poor hitting players
are just as likely to land a hit when at-bat than very good hitting players. Recall that
at the beginning of this section we stated that this type of model will overestimate
player's chances that hit poorly while underestimating player's chances that hit well.
We will revisit this in the next section, but take note that this is the case for this
model.

In hindsight our complete pooling model may seem trivial in that we successfully
obtained the mean and its standard deviation through a probabilistic programming manner.
Why would we do this when we can calculate the mean and the standard deviation from the
given data and get pretty close to the values we would calculate using a PPL technique?
Well, we can do better, but before we do better we are going to make another model that
is equally as bad as our complete pooling one. The reason why we do this will be come
evident when we get to our third and final model the [partial-pooling
model](#partial-pooling).

### No-pooling model


![](assets/img/no-pooling-dag.svg)


`No-pooling` is the polar opposite to `complete-pooling`, where instead of treating each
player identically we will treat each player as having their own separate chance of
landing a hit when at-bat. Essentially we will be creating a model for each player
(every player has their own distribution to sample from, $\theta$) and each model will
have no influence on any of the other models. We will see later on that choosing a
`no-pooling` model overestimates top batter's chances while underestimating poor
batter's chances. Note that this is the opposite to what the `complete-pooling` model
did and to our data story that says players are _similar_ not exactly unique.

We will use Bean Machine to create this type of model as follows.

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \theta&\sim\text{Beta}(1,1)\\
  y&\sim\text{Binomial}(K,\theta)
\end{aligned}
$$


```python
@bm.random_variable
def no_pooling_theta() -> RVIdentifier:
    return dist.Beta(1, 1).expand((N,))


@bm.random_variable
def no_pooling_y() -> RVIdentifier:
    return dist.Binomial(current_at_bats, no_pooling_theta())
```

Coding the `no-pooling` and `complete-pooling` models are quite similar. Note that the
difference between the two models is that we use `expand` on the prior and not in the
likelihood.


#### No-pooling inference


Just like before we will use the `GlobalNoUTurnSampler` inference method. We construct
the observations dictionary exactly to how we constructed it in the `complete-pooling`
model.


```python
no_pooling_observations = {no_pooling_y(): current_hits}
```

The queries we are interested in from this model are all the $\theta$'s as they are the
distributions for each player's individual chances of landing a hit.


```python
no_pooling_queries = [no_pooling_theta()]
no_pooling_samples = bm.GlobalNoUTurnSampler().infer(
    queries=no_pooling_queries,
    observations=no_pooling_observations,
    num_samples=num_samples,
    num_chains=num_chains,
    num_adaptive_samples=num_adaptive_samples,
)
```

trace plots.

All the $\hat{R}$ values look close to 1, and our `ess` for both the bulk and tail
regions are large. Below we plot all the diagnostics we did for the `complete-pooling`
model above. Since we created a model for each player, we have a large number of
diagnostic plots.


```python
# Required for visualizing in Colab.
output_notebook(hide_banner=True)

no_pooling_diagnostic_plots = baseball.plot_no_pooling_diagnostics(
    no_pooling_samples,
    no_pooling_theta(),
    df,
)
no_pooling_diag_plots = gridplot([*no_pooling_diagnostic_plots])
show(no_pooling_diag_plots)
```

<NoPoolingDiagPlots />

All of our visual diagnostics above look good. Posteriors are smooth, `ess` plots look
linear, density and rank plots for each chain look uniform and autocorrelation plots are
decent. Our model successfully created parameters for each player (all the $\theta$s).
From the posterior plots (the plots with the HDI statements) we can see that the players
have different chances of hitting a when at-bat. Roberto Clemente appears to have a much
higher chance of getting a hit than Max Alvis does.

In the below plot we show the predicted chance of landing a hit when at-bat for our
first two models. As we stated at the beginning of this section the no-pooling model
underestimates weak hitting player's chances of a hit, and overestimates good hitting
player's chances of a hit. Recall that the complete-pooling model did the exact
opposite, which was to overestimate weak player's chances of hitting and underestimating
strong player's chances of hitting when at-bat. This effect is quite apparent when
looking at the no-pooling plot to the right _vs_ the complete-pooling plot on the left.

We again plot posterior means for each player and the whiskers show the 89% HDI. The
grey line is found by setting

$$
y=\frac{\text{Current hits}}{\text{Current at-bats}}.
$$

Since this is also our x-axis, we have a straight line.


```python
# Required for visualizing in Colab.
output_notebook(hide_banner=True)

no_pooling_model_plot = baseball.plot_no_pooling_model(
    no_pooling_samples,
    no_pooling_theta(),
    df,
)
complete_no_plot = gridplot([[complete_pooling_model_plot, no_pooling_model_plot]])
show(complete_no_plot)
```

<CompleteNoPlot />

Player's chances for the no-pooling model show a wide spread from around 0.2 to around
0.4. It turns out that a hitting average for MLB players in the high 300's (0.3 in our
model) is quite rare, see [Wikipedia (All-time-players)](#references) for historical
context. Our no-pooling model certainly overestimated strong player's chances of landing
a hit when at-bat, and it did so with gusto.

So far we have not done a good job of telling our data story through our models. Our
complete-pooling model said every player was the same, while our no-pooling model said
all players are uniquely different. However, our data story said that all players are
different, but similar. What we have done so far is to model the extreme cases for our
data. In the next section we will combine these two models such that we have a more
accurate representation of player's chances when at-bat.


<a id="parital-pooling"></a>

### Partial-pooling model


![](assets/img/partial-pooling-dag.svg)


Partial pooling combines [complete-pooling](#complete-pooling) and
[no-pooling](#no-pooling) models to create a hybrid model that creates separate models
for each player _and simultaneously_ models the population. We do not have any data on
the MLB population, but we can still create a model of it through our hierarchical
model. Essentially what the model does is create separate parameters for each player
(the $\theta$s) and assumes that each $\theta$ is sampled from the same distribution
$(\phi)$, see above. The partial-pooling model does a better job of estimating all
batter's chances using information about the population. It will also do a better job of
estimating poor hitter's chances and good hitter's chances.

Our model is then

$$
\begin{aligned}
  \phi&\sim\text{Beta}(1, 1)\\
  \kappa&\sim\text{Pareto}(1, 1.5)\\
  \theta&\sim\text{Beta}(\phi * \kappa, (1- \phi) * \kappa)\\
  y&\sim\text{Binomial}(K, \theta)
\end{aligned}
$$

The new component of the model is the $\kappa$ parameter, which is sampled from a
`Pareto` distribution. $\kappa$ has been introduced to this model because $\theta$, the
distribution for each player's chance of getting a hit when at-bat, has priors $\alpha$
and $\beta$, which both need to be estimated. $\kappa$ can be thought of as the
population "concentration". For a more thorough discussion about $\kappa$, see
[Carpenter 2016](#references).


#### Priors for the partial-pooling model


Just as we did before, we plot a few curves of the Pareto distribution with varying
parameters to get a sense of what our priors look like.


```python
# Required for visualizing in Colab.
output_notebook(hide_banner=True)

pareto_plot = baseball.plot_pareto_prior()
show(pareto_plot)
```

<ParetoPlot />

We can code our partial pooling model easily in Bean Machine. All we need to do is
reintroduce $\phi$ as our estimate for the population's chance for hitting a ball when
at-bat, keep our model for each individual's chance for successfully hitting when at-bat
$\theta$, and introduce $\kappa$ as our population concentration.


```python
@bm.random_variable
def partial_pooling_phi() -> RVIdentifier:
    return dist.Beta(1, 1)


@bm.random_variable
def partial_pooling_kappa() -> RVIdentifier:
    return dist.Pareto(1, 1.5)


@bm.random_variable
def partial_pooling_theta() -> RVIdentifier:
    alpha = partial_pooling_phi() * partial_pooling_kappa()
    beta = (1 - partial_pooling_phi()) * partial_pooling_kappa()
    return dist.Beta(alpha, beta).expand((N,))


@bm.random_variable
def partial_pooling_y() -> RVIdentifier:
    return dist.Binomial(current_at_bats, partial_pooling_theta())
```

#### Partial-pooling inference


Again we construct our observations into a dictionary, and sample using the
`GlobalNoUTurnSampler`. The major difference between our previous models and this one,
is that we now have more than one Bean Machine random variable to include in the
`queries` parameter of the `infer` method.


```python
partial_pooling_observations = {partial_pooling_y(): current_hits}
partial_pooling_queries = [
    partial_pooling_kappa(),
    partial_pooling_phi(),
    partial_pooling_theta(),
]
partial_pooling_samples = bm.GlobalNoUTurnSampler().infer(
    queries=partial_pooling_queries,
    observations=partial_pooling_observations,
    num_samples=num_samples,
    num_chains=num_chains,
    num_adaptive_samples=num_adaptive_samples,
)
```

All summary diagnostics $(\hat{R}\text{ and }ess$) look good. All our `ess` evolution
plots also look linear and breach the 400 rule-of-thumb threshold. Rank plots all look
fairly uniform and our autocorrelation plots look good. You will notice that the
autocorrelation plot for $\kappa$ has highly correlated draws with initial lags. We
could sample for longer chains in order to try and alleviate these correlations.

Below we show how the model affects estimated chances of hitting when at-bat for each
player. We compare this new model to the other model plots and see that the
partial-pooling model effectively increases weak player's chances of landing a hit,
while also decreasing strong player's chances of a hit.


```python
# Required for visualizing in Colab.
output_notebook(hide_banner=True)

partial_pooling_model_plot = baseball.plot_partial_pooling_model(
    partial_pooling_samples,
    df,
)
model_plots = gridplot(
    [
        [
            complete_pooling_model_plot,
            no_pooling_model_plot,
        ],
        [
            partial_pooling_model_plot,
        ],
    ]
)
show(model_plots)
```

The partial-pooling model has shifted our predictions. In fact, it has captured our data
story, which stated that MLB players are unique (they do not lie on the population mean
orange line) and yet they are not all that different (they do not fall on the grey
line). What we see is that player's chances of hitting a ball when at-bat have moved
closer to the mean line from their positions in the no-pooling model.


```python
# Required for visualizing in Colab.
output_notebook(hide_banner=True)

shrinkage_plot = baseball.plot_shrinkage(
    no_pooling_samples, partial_pooling_samples, df
)
show(shrinkage_plot)
```

## Conclusion


To sum up

* Our complete-pooling model

  * overestimated weak player's chances of landing a hit
  * underestimated strong player's chances of landing a hit
  * gave us posterior mean estimates within the population mean.


* Our no-pooling model

  * underestimated weak player's chances of landing a hit
  * overestimated strong player's chances of landing a hit.


* Our partial-pooling model

  * estimated a player's chance of landing a hit regardless if they hit poorly or well.


With our limited data we were able to create a model that gives us a player's chance of
success when at-bat. Bayesian inference has given us a way to make more accurate
predictions about a player's chance of success with a small data set and Bean Machine
made creating those models very easy.
