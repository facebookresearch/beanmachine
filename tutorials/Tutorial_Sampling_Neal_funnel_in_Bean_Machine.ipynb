This makes it challenging to learn a good scale for proposal updates. Let's go about modeling this in Bean Machine!\n",

In the typical problem setup found in other tutorials, there are ground-truth values that we're trying to infer distributions about based on observed data. In this case, however, we're trying to exactly replicate a ground-truth _distribution_, by using the mechanics of the Bean Machine inference engine to guide the sampling process.\n",

    "\n",
    "  1. Sample priors for $z$ and $x$.\n",
    "  2. Imagine weighting the probabilities of $z$ and $x$ according to how likely they are under the true Neal's funnel model. We can do this by imagining we're flipping a coin, where the probability of it landing heads is the probability of drawing that $z$ and $x$ from the Neal's funnel model, but where we've actually _observed_ it to be heads.\n",
    "  3. Later, we will inform the inference engine that we observed heads. This will cause the engine to find values for $z$ and $x$ that are consistent with samples from the true Neal's funnel posterior -- since those are the samples that would have resulted in the observed \"heads\" from our coin flip!\n",

However, that's giving inference an unfair advantage, since our priors exactly match our posterior. Instead, in this tutorial we will choose noninformative priors.\n",
    "    <li>It is common to refer to this coin-flipping approach as a \"factor\". Traditionally, PPLs have been implemented by weighting a particular run of inference according to the log probability of that run of inference. We're exactly doing that in this model -- based on a particular draw of $z$ and $x$, we're weighting that overall run by the probability that those values would have been sampled from the true Neal's funnel posterior.\n",

    "    <li>Though they return distributions, callees actually receive <i>samples</i> from the distribution. The machinery for obtaining samples from distributions is handled internally by Bean Machine.\n",
    "    <li>Inference runs the model through many iterations. During a particular inference iteration, a distinct random variable will correspond to exactly one sampled value: <b>calls to the same random variable function with the same arguments will receive the same sampled value within one inference iteration</b>. This makes it easy for multiple components of your model to refer to the same logical random variable.\n",
    "    <li>Consequently, to define distinct random variables that correspond to different sampled values during a particular inference iteration, an effective practice is to add a dummy \"indexing\" parameter to the function. Distinct random variables can be referred to with different values for this index.\n",

    "We configure block inference using the method `add_sequential_proposer`, which takes a list of variables as an argument. Note that, unlike in typical Bean Machine syntax, we don't include arguments to variable objects when defining the block inference scheme. This is because the framework can compute the minimal _specific_ set of variables to update from the random variable families provided to this function. The next paragraph explains how that block selection is performed, and is quite technical! Feel free to skip it if desired.\n",

    "  Block inference selects specific subsets of random variables to update jointly. This is based upon which variables would typically be included in one another's Markov blanket during a single-site update. The Markov blanket of a random variable is a statistical concept defining which  other random variables may be directly affected when we propose a new value for the current random variable. It includes the current random variable's parents, children, and parents-of-children. Therefore, <code>z</code> and <code>x</code> <i>always</i> end up blocked together in this simple example. Our single-site inference typically runs inference individually for <code>z</code> and <code>x</code>, doing separate accept-reject procedures for each individual node of the probabilistic model. With block inference, before computing the accept-reject probability on <code>z</code>, the method will search the Markov blanket of <code>z</code> to find all variables that would be directly affected by an update to <code>z</code>. In this case, <code>x</code> will be blocked together with <code>z</code>, since that's what we configured with <code>add_sequential_proposer</code>. New proposals for <i>all</i> of these variables will be jointly accepted or rejected together. Read more about block inference in our documentation.\n",
