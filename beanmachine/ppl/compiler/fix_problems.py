fix all the problems which prevent it from being a legal Bean Machine
Graph, such as violations of type system requirements or use of
unsupported operators.

The basic idea is that every *edge* in the graph has a *requirement*, such as
"the type of the input must be Probability".  We do a traversal of the input
edges of every node in the graph; if the input node meets the requirement,
it is unchanged. If it does not, then a new node that has the same semantics
that meets the requirement is returned. If there is no such node then an
error is added to the error report."""
