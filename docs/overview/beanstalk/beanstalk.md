### Beanstalk compiler
What types of models are supported by our Bean Machine compiler.

### Beanstalk uses the Bean Machine Graph (BMG) library
With code generated that is powered by the Bean Machine Graph (BMG) library, which runs critical pieces of code in C++ rather than Python, to speed up the inference process significantly.

Facebook specific:

 These models are also frequently used at Facebook including Team Power and Metric Ranking products (https://fb.workplace.com/notes/418250526036381) as well as new pilot studies on https://fb.quip.com/GxwQAIscFRz8 and https://fb.quip.com/UMmcAr2zczbc. Additionally, the Probabilistic Programming Languages (https://www.internalfb.com/intern/bunny/?q=group%20pplxfn) (PPL) team has collected a list of https://fb.quip.com/rrMAAuk02Jqa who can benefit from our HME methodology.

Let's quickly translate the model we discussed in the [Introduction](../introduction/introduction.md) into Bean Machine code! Although this will get you up-and-running, **it's important that you read through all of the pages in the Overview to have a complete understanding of Bean Machine**. Happy modeling!
