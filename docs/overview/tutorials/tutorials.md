## Where to Start
Tutorials in Bean Machine demonstrate various types of statistical models that users can build in Bean Machine. If you are just getting started with Bean Machine, we recommend you work through 1 or 2 of the most basic tutorials, then consider if you might be better served by a [Package](../packages/packages.md) first, before customizing a more advanced tutorial.

### Beanstalk compiler
Additionally, consider if you can structure your statistical model in such a way that it can perform at much faster speeds, by compilation into C++. See our [Beanstalk](../beanstalk/beanstalk.md) compiler details for more information on what types of models are supported by our Bean Machine compiler.
